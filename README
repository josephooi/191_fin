Brief notes about the post-receive script:
- runs when there is an update (push) to the git repo server-side
- location of the git repo: git@ec2-54-214-126-55.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/gitrepos/project.git
- the script pulls the updates into ~/project-update
- the script copies the server.html file from ~/project-update to ~/ (where the files are being served)

Simple server accessible at: ec2-54-214-126-55.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/server.html
